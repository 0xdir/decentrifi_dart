/// A Future-based library for interacting with Decentrifi's Defi Hub
///
/// Decentrifi's Defi Hub is a defi aggregation API which serves
/// as a gateway to decentralized finance by abstracting common
/// principles and domains.
///
/// It unifies all concepts of lending, borrowing, vaults, farming
/// and staking to easy to integrate elements.
///
/// It consists of a set of SDKS, smart contracts
/// and graphs that contribute to a defi aggregation API.
///
/// It's a fully open source API that lets you easily integrate
/// DeFi in wallets and applications without having to know
/// the specific underlying domain of the protocols and chains.
